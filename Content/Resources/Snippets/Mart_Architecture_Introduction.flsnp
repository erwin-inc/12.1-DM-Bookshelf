        <p class="bodytext">In the previous versions, erwin DM connected to the Mart database through the database client software. Now, the application connects to the Mart database through a web server. The database client software is no longer required. The web server includes a web-based administration console erwin Mart Administrator. If you are using the Workgroup Edition, you must install and configure erwin Mart Administrator. </p>
