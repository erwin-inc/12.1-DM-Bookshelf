        <h2 class="heading2" id="t1567">(Optional) Select Advanced Options to Refine the Compare Criteria</h2>
        <p class="bodytext">Use the options in the Complete Compare - Advanced Options Selection pane to select the generic compare criteria. The criteria that you select here apply to all the objects that you have selected so far. The options that you select here determine how you want to compare.</p>
        <p class="proceduresubheading">Follow these steps: </p>
        <ol class="listnumber">
            <li class="listnumber">Click the Advanced Options link in the navigation pane and choose the required options from the following options:
<dl><dt>Auto dispose Database/Script Models</dt><dd><p class="normaltermcontinued2">Closes the model that is created from the database or script, automatically when you end the compare session. The option to save the model is not displayed.</p></dd><dt>Auto resolve missing UDPs</dt><dd><p class="normaltermcontinued2">Copies the missing UDPs to the target model, when all the differences are due to missing UDPs. Complete Compare detects missing UDPs or property differences for common UDPs and displays the Type Resolution dialog before the Complete Compare session. Select this check box to skip the Type Resolution dialog when all the differences are due to missing UDPs.</p></dd><dt>Case Sensitive Compare</dt><dd><p class="normaltermcontinued2">Performs a case-sensitive compare. This option affects both the alignment of objects in the object tree and the equality of property values in the property pane. When the option is cleared, case is ignored for the purposes of alignment and equality testing of text property values.</p></dd><dt>Exclude Unaligned Objects in the Left Model</dt><dd><p class="normaltermcontinued2">Excludes unaligned model-level objects from the left model in the Resolve Differences dialog. Use this option as a filter to distinguish between changes in a model subset and a larger model of which the subset is a part.</p></dd><dt>Exclude Unaligned Objects in the Right Model</dt><dd><p class="normaltermcontinued2">Excludes unaligned model-level objects from the right model in the Resolve Differences dialog. Use this option as a filter to distinguish between changes in a model subset and a larger model of which the subset is a part.</p><p class="noteAlt">You can select both, Exclude Unaligned Objects in the Left Model and Exclude Unaligned Objects in the Right model to compare only the objects that are present in both the models.</p></dd><dt>Ignore Code Comments</dt><dd><p class="normaltermcontinued2">Excludes blocks of comments from the body of a trigger, before including it in the compare process. If the only difference is in the comments, excluding comments enables Complete Compare to recognize that a trigger has not changed.</p></dd><dt>Include Only Generated Objects</dt><dd><p class="normaltermcontinued2">Includes objects for which the Generate check box in the property editor is selected. The Generate check box specifies whether you want to generate SQL for the object during forward engineering. </p></dd><dt>Prefix Owner</dt><dd><p class="normaltermcontinued2">Matches by prefix table owner. When you select this option, objects are aligned based on both the name and owner name property.</p></dd><dt>Select Active Subject Area</dt><dd><p class="normaltermcontinued2">Specifies that you want to select the active subject area by default in the Object Selection pane. Selecting a subject area by default simplifies the selection, especially in models that contain many subject areas.</p></dd><dt>Tablespace in Database</dt><dd><p class="normaltermcontinued2">Aligns objects according to both, the IN_TABLESPACE and IN_DATABASE properties, where applicable. This option is available only for the Db2 z/OS database server.</p></dd><dt>Using Database Id Matching</dt><dd><p class="normaltermcontinued2">Matches by Database ID. This option is available for Informix, SAP ASE, and SQL Server database servers only. If the DB ID property is present, objects are aligned based on the property. Database IDs are present only in models that are reverse-engineered from a database. Select this property to compare a model with the same model that is reverse-engineered from a database.</p></dd><dt>Using Name Matching</dt><dd><p class="normaltermcontinued2">Matches by object name. Relationship, index, and index members are aligned based on the name, in addition to the normal criteria used to align these objects. Use this property if the models that are being compared have the same named objects with different owners. In this case, you can compare to see if the two models are similar other than the owner or schema name. </p></dd><dt>Using Object Id Matching</dt><dd><p class="normaltermcontinued2">Aligns objects that are based on the Object ID property, where applicable. This option is available for the Db2 z/OS database server only. </p></dd></dl></li>
            <li class="listnumber">Click Compare to begin the compare process.
<p class="listcontinue">The options are saved and the compare process begins. The compare process is displayed in a progress bar. When the compare process ends, the results are displayed in the Resolve Difference dialog.</p></li>

<p class="listcontinue2">This filter does not affect property rows. This filter is selected by default when the Resolve Differences dialog opens.</p></li><li class="listbullet2">To view the objects that exist only in the right model, click the Show Unaligned Objects on the Left.
<p class="listcontinue2">This filter does not affect property rows. This filter is selected by default when the Resolve Differences dialog opens.</p></li><li class="listbullet2">To copy an item that does not match, from the right model to the left model click the Copy item to the Left icon.
</li><li class="listbullet2">To copy an item that does not match, from the left model to the right model, click the Copy item to the Right icon.
</li><li class="listbullet2">To match two items, click the Match two items icon.
<p class="listcontinue2">Use this feature to override automatic matching. You first select an object, click the match icon, then click an object or property with which to match the first object. The items then appear on the same line in the Object View. The toolbar buttons are available or unavailable (dimmed) depending on whether the action is available for the selected item. </p></li><li class="listbullet2">To unmatch items that have been matched, click the Unmatch two items icon.
<p class="listcontinue2">The items then appear on separate lines in the Object View. The status of the selected item is changed, and the model is updated accordingly.</p></li></ul></li>
            <li class="listnumber">(Optional) Generate a comparison report using the following steps:
<ol class="listalpha"><li class="listalpha">In the Resolve Differences dialog, click the Show Report icon.
<p class="listcontinue2">The Report dialog opens.</p></li><li class="listalpha">Choose the format in which to display the report and then click OK.
<p class="listcontinue2">Your report is generated and displayed in the chosen format.</p></li></ol></li>
            <li class="listnumber">(Optional) View the explanation for the differences between objects using the following steps:
<ol class="listalpha"><li class="listalpha">Right-click a difference either in the Object View or in the Property View and click Explain to open the Explanation dialog.

        <div class="noteAlt">
            <ul class="listbullet2">
                <li class="listbullet2">To add an entire object, use the Export or Import icon in the Object View pane. Similarly, to add a property to an object, use the Export or Import icon in the Property View pane. For example, to add a nonkey column to a table, export the column at the Object View. Similarly, to change the datatype of an existing nonkey column, change it at the Property View level.
</li>
                <li class="listbullet2">The guidelines that govern importing or exporting objects are same as that of creating objects manually in the model. For example, you create a Foreign Key in the model by creating a relationship. Similarly, import or export a Foreign Key, by importing or exporting the relationship. To import or export a relationship, help ensure that both parent and child tables are in the scope of comparison.
</li>
                <li class="listbullet2">The changes made in the Resolve Differences dialog follow the same guidelines as the changes made in a model. To create a check constraint, you create a Validation Rule in the model, associate the rule with a column, and give it a unique name. Similarly, to import or export a column with a check constraint, import or export the corresponding Validation Rule as well.
